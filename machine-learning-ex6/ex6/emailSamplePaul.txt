Dear students,

 This is a reminder that the projects are due on Monday (evening, as I was asked). As usual, the deadline is flexible but late projects will be penalized (for a same quality, a project submitted on Wednesday will reach a lower grade than one on Tuesday, etc.). The submission site is the usual one:

 On another topic: any remark about the course (positive or negative, what to improve, etc.) is welcomed here:
https://www.lri.fr/~gcharpia/machinelearningcourse/comments/
The comments are anonymous.
